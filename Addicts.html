    <!-- START OF ARTICLE CONTENT --><h2>Part I: Bloody Addicts</h2>
<p class="meta">A reflection on distraction, attention, and self-recognition • Pranjal Vats</p>
    <p>I won’t start with pleasantries. Those are distractions—and this chapter is about distractions.</p>
    <p>My name is Pranjal. I come from a very supportive family, and a society where dreams are taught early and comfort is postponed indefinitely. I grew up knowing—almost instinctively—that growth wasn’t optional. If I wanted a better life for my family and myself, I would have to earn it, inch by inch.</p>
    <p>That’s enough of an introduction. Let’s begin.</p>
    <hr class="divider" /><h3>Chapter 1: The Accepted Escape</h3>
    <p>Today wasn’t extraordinary. No milestones. No achievements worth announcing.</p>
    <p>And yet, I learned something unsettling—something that stayed with me long after the day ended.</p>
    <p>On my way back from CLAT coaching, I was stuck in traffic. The kind that doesn’t move but still exhausts you. My phone battery was low, so for once, I didn’t reach for it. I put it aside, as if saving it for an emergency—though I didn’t know what the emergency was.</p>
    <p>Out of boredom, I looked out of the window.</p>
    <p><em>That’s when I saw it…</em></p>
    <p>A world full of addicts.</p>
    <p>Not the kind you imagine when you hear the word—messy hair, scars, dark rooms. These addicts were well-dressed, sitting comfortably in cars, buses, autos. Heads bent. Fingers scrolling. Eyes glazed.</p>
    <p>Everyone was absorbed—in texts, music, videos, games. Not present. Not aware. Just… elsewhere.</p><p>Some of them, I admit, might have been genuinely busy. But most were simply avoiding the real world—trying to feel occupied.</p>
    <p>There was a car beside me. Seven people inside.</p>
    <p>Two kids playing Battleground, fingers moving faster than thought. A teenage girl staring endlessly at a photograph of an actor. A mother scrolling—up, down—lost in a loop with no destination. The father watching Netflix, headphones sealing him off from the family inches away. Perhaps the grandfather recording a vlog, narrating a moment he wasn’t living.</p>
    <p>And the driver?</p>
    <p>The driver was texting.</p>
    <p><strong>Seven people. Seven screens. Not one conversation.</strong></p>
    <p>I felt disturbed—but also strangely superior. Observant. Awake.</p>
    <p>That’s when the discomfort deepened.</p>
    <p>There’s a psychological phenomenon: once you notice something, you begin to see it everywhere. Frequency illusion, they call it. Or maybe it’s just awareness arriving late.</p>
    <p>On the way home, I saw more of them. And more.</p>
    <p>By the time I reached my room, a thought crept in—quiet, cold, undeniable.</p>
    <p>The chill down my spine wasn’t from what I saw outside. It was from what I realized inside.</p>
    <p><strong>I wasn’t just watching the addicts. I was one of them.</strong></p>
    <p>That realization—that moment of recognition—is where this story truly begins.</p>
    
    <hr class="divider" /><h3>Chapter 2: The Quiet Betrayal</h3>
    <p>You cannot betray someone you do not care about. That is why the most painful betrayal is always against yourself.</p>
    <p>Nobody warned me that self-betrayal wouldn’t feel dramatic. It arrived quietly—disguised as comfort, as rest, as “just this once.”</p>
    <p>It usually began with a small promise.</p>
    <p><em>I’ll start after this. Just five minutes more. I deserve a break today.</em></p>
    <p>These weren’t lies spoken aloud. They were contracts signed silently. And the danger wasn’t that I broke them—it was that I broke them so often they stopped feeling important.</p>
    <p>I trusted myself a little less every time I chose comfort over effort.</p>
    <p>Discipline isn’t punishment. It’s honesty. It’s the courage to face discomfort instead of escaping it.</p>
    <p>The real cost of distraction wasn’t time. It was identity.</p>
    <p>I didn’t just lose hours—I lost belief in my own word. And without that belief, ambition begins to sound hollow.</p>
    <p>The hardest person to face isn’t society. It’s the version of yourself you keep disappointing without realizing it.</p>
    <p>The betrayal was quiet. But it was constant.</p>
    
    <hr class="divider" /><h3>Chapter 3: When the Noise Stopped</h3>
    <p>I didn’t quit my phone. I didn’t delete apps. I simply stopped running from silence.</p>
    <p>Silence wasn’t peaceful. It was loud.</p>
    <p>It brought back thoughts I had avoided. But beneath that discomfort was something honest.</p>
    <p>Boredom isn’t emptiness. It’s the mind returning to itself.</p>
    <p>I didn’t change overnight. Awareness didn’t cure me—it gave me a choice.</p>
    <p>Presence didn’t make life easier. It made it clearer.</p>
    <p>This chapter isn’t about rejecting technology. It’s about reclaiming attention—the rarest currency of this century.</p>
    <p><strong>The noise didn’t disappear. I just stopped letting it decide who I am.</strong></p>
