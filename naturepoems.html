      <h2>Earth Eternal, Man Ephemeral 🌍</h2>
      <p>
Mountains rise, rivers flow,  
Seasons come, seasons go.  
Forests whisper, oceans roar,  
Earth remains forevermore.  

Yet man walks with head held high,  
Believing he commands the sky.  
Taming rivers, carving stone,  
Calling this vast world his own.  

He builds his towers, stakes his claim,  
Writes his laws, bestows his name.  
Forgets the dust from which he came,  
And thinks the Earth will bow the same.  

But winds will sweep, the roots will grow,  
Mountains crumble, rivers flow.  
Time erases every hand,  
No kingdom stays, no name will stand.  

For nature’s song is old and wise,  
It hums beyond where memory lies.  
Man may dream of endless reign,  
Yet he will turn to dust again.

      <h2>Whispers of the Wind 🍂</h2>
      <p>
The wind speaks softly through the trees,  
A secret carried on gentle breeze.  
It hums of ages, lost and gone,  
Yet whispers life to carry on.

      <h2>River’s Song 🌊</h2>
      <p>
A river carves with patient grace,  
Through rock, through time, it finds its place.  
No rush, no force, just steady flow,  
A lesson in the way to grow.

      <h2>Roots Beneath 🌱</h2>
      <p>
We see the tree, its crown, its might,  
But roots hold steady out of sight.  
In hidden soil, they weave, they stay,  
The strength that keeps the storms away.

      <h2>Whispers of Night 🌌</h2>
      <p>
The sky is painted deep and wide,  
A velvet sea where stars reside.  
They shimmer soft, they whisper light,  
A thousand wishes born tonight.  

The moonlight hums a silent tune,  
Silvered dreams beneath its bloom.  
The wind it sighs, the heart it yearns,  
For time to turn, for fate to burn.  

Eyes that wander, lost in glow,  
Holding stories yet to grow.  
A quiet hope, a secret flight,  
Waiting for the perfect night.  

Oh, distant dreams, just past my hand,  
Like golden dust, like grains of sand.  
Still I wait, still I believe,  
That time will come, that stars will weave.  

So let them shine, let midnight call,  
A dreamer waits—she wants it all.  
With stars above and heart so wide,  
She walks with hope, and time as guide.

      <h2>Under Starlit Dreams ✨</h2>
      <p>
The night is quiet, soft, and deep,  
The stars above, their secrets keep.  
They shimmer bright, they call my name,  
Like tiny sparks of hope and flame.  

The breeze is light, it sings so low,  
A song of dreams I used to know.  
I close my eyes and let it be,  
The night, the stars, just time and me.  

I wait for dawn, I wait for light,  
I wait for dreams to take their flight.  
But till they come, I stand so still,  
With stars above and heart to fill.

      <h2>The Shape of Water 💦</h2>
      <p>
It drips in silence, soft and small,  
A silver thread, unnoticed fall—  
It bends to shape, to cup, to stream,  
It hides in mist, it sighs in dream.  

It takes the form of what it meets,  
The mountain cracks, the city's streets.  
In glass or gulf, in storm or dew,  
It molds itself, yet remains true.  

So simple—clear, with no disguise,  
Yet holds the world within its guise.  
Ignored in peace, praised in drought,  
Yet none can truly live without.  

It carves through stone with quiet grace,  
No rush—just time to claim its place.  
It heals, it feeds, it bears, it grows,  
In every breath, its presence flows.  

But oh—when fury floods its soul,  
No dam, no prayer can take control.  
It swallows lands, it breaks the chain,  
No throne, no war can it contain.  

So judge it not by calm alone,  
This quiet force we all have known.  
For water—gentle, vast, and free—  
Is strength wrapped in humility.
