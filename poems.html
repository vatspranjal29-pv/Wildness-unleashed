  <h1>Poems & Ideas</h1>

    <h2>1.The Untamed Fire</h2>
    <p>
      There is no such thing as perfection,<br>
      My imperfections pave the way,<br>
      Something wild, free, and unbroken,<br>
      A storm that refuses to obey.

  <h2>2.Salt</h2>
  <p>
    I am like salt, simple and small,<br>
    Yet I blend in quietly, touching all.<br>
    In every dish, in every soul,<br>
    I never seek to take control.<br><br>

    Too little of me—you’ll feel the lack,<br>
    A silent space, a subtle crack.<br>
    Too much—and I’ll sting the tongue,<br>
    A harmony lost, a song unsung.<br><br>

    I walk with fire, laugh with rain,<br>
    Ease your joy, and soothe your pain.<br>
    I don’t need to shine or lead,<br>
    Just be the part that others need.<br><br>

    From the richest plate to the poorest fare,<br>
    You’ll find my spirit lingering there.<br>
    Not loud or proud, but always true—<br>
    A silent strength that carries through.<br><br>

    I shift, I mold, I find my place,<br>
    In every heart, in every space.<br>
    Call me humble, or call me wise—<br>
    I am salt—small, but I rise.

    <h2>3.Dream of Rebellion</h2>
    <p>
      They told me to fit in,<br>
      But I carve my own mark,<br>
      The night is my canvas,<br>
      And my name ignites the dark.
    </p>

  <h2>4.Will I Regret?</h2>
  <p>
    Will I regret the times I stalled,<br>
    The chances missed, the dreams I called—<br>
    Then left unheard, beneath my doubt,<br>
    Too scared to scream, too worn to shout?<br><br>

    Will I regret the work half-done,<br>
    The races lost I could have won?<br>
    The lazy days, the fleeting fire,<br>
    The faded edge of once desire?<br><br>

    I tell myself, "You'll make it still,"<br>
    But time won't pause for fading will.<br>
    Each hour that slips through idle hands,<br>
    Could build the life my soul demands.<br><br>

    Will I regret not giving all,<br>
    When I still had the strength to fall—<br>
    And rise again, with dirt and grace,<br>
    Instead of quitting at half pace?<br><br>

    But maybe… maybe I will learn,<br>
    That purpose isn't always stern.<br>
    That stumbles count, that trying slow,<br>
    Still leads somewhere—still helps me grow.<br><br>

    So will I regret? The fear runs deep,<br>
    But I’ll build something I can keep.<br>
    Not perfect paths or flawless days—<br>
    But truth I lived in flawed, real ways.
