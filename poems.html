        <h2 class="title">Will I Regret...</h2>
        <div class="excerpt">Will I regret the times I stalled,
The chances missed, the dreams I called—
Then left unheard, beneath my doubt,
Too scared to scream, too worn to shout?</div>
        <div class="full" aria-hidden="true">Will I regret the times I stalled,
The chances missed, the dreams I called—
Then left unheard, beneath my doubt,
Too scared to scream, too worn to shout?

Will I regret the work half-done,
The races lost I could have won?
The lazy days, the fleeting fire,
The faded edge of once desire?

I tell myself, "You'll make it still,"
But time won't pause for fading will.
Each hour that slips through idle hands,
Could build the life my soul demands.

Will I regret not giving all,
When I still had the strength to fall—
And rise again, with dirt and grace,
Instead of quitting at half pace?

But maybe… maybe I will learn,
That purpose isn't always stern.
That stumbles count, that trying slow,
Still leads somewhere—still helps me grow.

So will I regret? The fear runs deep,
But I’ll build something I can keep.
Not perfect paths or flawless days—
But truth I lived in flawed, real ways.</div>

        <h2 class="title">Like Salt 🧂</h2>
        <div class="excerpt">I am like salt, simple and small,
Yet I blend in quietly, touching all.
In every dish, in every soul,
I never seek to take control.</div>
        <div class="full" aria-hidden="true">I am like salt, simple and small,  
Yet I blend in quietly, touching all.  
In every dish, in every soul,  
I never seek to take control.  

Too little of me—you’ll feel the lack,  
A silent space, a subtle crack.  
Too much—and I’ll sting the tongue,  
A harmony lost, a song unsung.  

I walk with fire, laugh with rain,  
Ease your joy, and soothe your pain.  
I don’t need to shine or lead,  
Just be the part that others need.  

From the richest plate to the poorest fare,  
You’ll find my spirit lingering there.  
Not loud or proud, but always true—  
A silent strength that carries through.  

I shift, I mold, I find my place,  
In every heart, in every space.  
Call me humble, or call me wise—  
I am salt—small, but I rise.</div>

        <h2 class="title">Clockwork Days ⏰</h2>
        <div class="excerpt">Tick-tock, tick-tock — the rhythm never sways,
I rise and fall in endless, numbered days.
A cog inside a giant, silent wheel,
No room to laugh, no time to feel.</div>
        <div class="full" aria-hidden="true">Tick-tock, tick-tock — the rhythm never sways,  
I rise and fall in endless, numbered days.  
A cog inside a giant, silent wheel,  
No room to laugh, no time to feel.  

Same street, same step, same weary breath,  
Each hour chimes a little death.  
Eyes on the screen, hands to the task,  
Beneath this skin, I wear a mask.  

No curveballs thrown, no sudden skies,  
Just blinking lights and tired eyes.  
Coffee, calls, and empty talk,  
Life reduced to a daily walk.  

No dance, no detour, no surprise,  
Just routine dressed in a thin disguise.  
A robot’s grace, a rusted soul,  
Marching on to someone else’s goal.  

I dream of mess, of wild delight,  
Of losing track of day and night.  
Of roads unplanned, of skies unknown,  
Of moments I can call my own.  

But still I tick, I tock, I turn,  
A silent ache, a buried yearn.  
For now, I move where I'm supposed to be,  
But deep inside — I long to break free.</div>

        <h2 class="title">What Will Happen? 🤔</h2>
        <div class="excerpt">I'm trying, yes, but not my best,
A silent war inside my chest.
I know the cost, I know the stakes,
Still find myself making mistakes.</div>
        <div class="full" aria-hidden="true">I'm trying, yes, but not my best,  
A silent war inside my chest.  
I know the cost, I know the stakes,  
Still find myself making mistakes.  

I want to rise, I want to prove,  
But some days I just cannot move.  
When fire burns, I give my all,  
When it goes dim, I slip, I fall.  

Motivation—fickle friend,  
Here one day, then meets its end.  
When it’s strong, I scale the sky,  
When it fades, I barely try.  

I ask myself, “What will this mean?”  
Will I be lost in might-have-beens?  
Will dreams decay in silent rust,  
All for a lack of constant trust?  

But deep inside, beneath the doubt,  
A voice still whispers, strong and loud:  
“You are not made of perfect days,  
But strength is shown in flawed displays.”  

So what will happen? Time will say,  
But I will rise in my own way.</div>

        <h2 class="title">I Am the Storm 🌪️</h2>
        <div class="excerpt">I was the quiet one, eyes full of flame,
Now they all shiver when they hear my name.
Mocked my dreams? Well, joke’s on you—
I built a throne from the shade you threw.</div>
        <div class="full" aria-hidden="true">I was the quiet one, eyes full of flame,  
Now they all shiver when they hear my name.  
Mocked my dreams? Well, joke’s on you—  
I built a throne from the shade you threw.  

Didn’t fit in? I never tried.  
Kings don’t blend, they multiply pride.  
Now I walk in with that “don’t-care” grin,  
And a fire so fierce, I burn to win.  

Friends turned rivals, haters in disguise,  
Watch me rise while they rehearse lies.  
I don’t flex cheap—I let my life scream,  
Luxury’s my silence, success is my scream.  

Call it revenge? I call it fate.  
You doubted gold ‘cause you saw it in slate.  
Now I shine like a war god’s crown,  
Watch me buy what once brought me down.  

No more limits, no second guess,  
I’m the calm chaos in tailored finesse.  
Spent too long being their maybe, their "not quite”—  
Now I’m first-class flying into every fight.  

I’m the answer to every eye that rolled,  
The living proof that stories unfold  
Not in their hands, not in their say—  
But in the silence of those who slay.  

You want humble? That phase is dead.  
Now I live bold, paint the skyline red.  
I'm not just rich—I'm out of your league,  
A walking revenge in designer intrigue.  

So when they ask, “How did you win?”  
I’ll smirk and say, “By never giving in.”  
Let my glow blind every fake smile swarm—  
I didn’t chase the light. I became the storm.</div>

        <h2 class="title">Salt in My Soul 🧂</h2>
        <div class="excerpt">I’m not the flame that steals the scene,
Nor the velvet in a royal sheen.
I’m quiet strength, not loud or bold,
But without me, the story feels cold.</div>
        <div class="full" aria-hidden="true">I’m not the flame that steals the scene,  
Nor the velvet in a royal sheen.  
I’m quiet strength, not loud or bold,  
But without me, the story feels cold.  

In laughter's feast or silence deep,  
In moments loud or ones you keep,  
I’m there—unseen but understood,  
The touch that turns bland into good.  

I sit with joy, I walk with grief,  
I bring a pause, I grant relief.  
I never beg, I never boast,  
But I become what you need most.  

With strangers, I am light and kind,  
With friends, a peace they’re glad to find.  
In chaos, I can hold the ground,  
In stillness, I can wear the crown.  

Adaptive, yes—yet still my core,  
Unchanged though I’m asked for more.  
I bend, but never disappear,  
I'm felt the most when I'm sincere.  

So taste and see—don’t rush or shove,  
I’m best when measured, shared with love.  
Not too much, nor barely there,  
Just enough—and I’m everywhere.</div>

        <h2 class="title">Running on Empty 🕯️</h2>
        <div class="excerpt">I used to wake with fire in my chest,
Now it’s just weight that won’t let me rest.
My calendar's full, but my soul feels thin,
Like I’m chasing a race I forgot to begin.</div>
        <div class="full" aria-hidden="true">I used to wake with fire in my chest,  
Now it’s just weight that won’t let me rest.  
My calendar's full, but my soul feels thin,  
Like I’m chasing a race I forgot to begin.  

Smiles worn like practiced art,  
But the cracks run deep beneath my heart.  
“Keep going,” they cheer — I nod, comply,  
Yet every breath feels like a lie.  

The to-dos scream louder than my needs,  
I water others, forget my own seeds.  
Eyes wide open, but the light is dim,  
Even silence feels like it’s wearing thin.  

It’s not that I’m weak, or don’t want to try,  
I’m just tired in ways no sleep can defy.  
A soul stretched thin, a mind worn out,  
An inner scream behind a whisper shout.  

But maybe rest is not defeat,  
Maybe pause is what makes strength complete.  
I’ll learn to breathe, not just survive—  
To stop, to heal, to feel alive.</div>

Till I forgot what I was doing it for.  
Each win felt empty, joy ran dry,  
Even the sunrise passed me by.  

They called me strong, they called me brave,  
But didn’t see the pieces I gave.  
Behind the work, beneath the grin,  
I barely knew the skin I’m in.  

Then one day—I didn’t rise.  
Just laid there, staring at the skies.  
And in that stillness, something stirred:  
A softer voice I hadn’t heard.  

“You don’t have to climb today.  
It’s okay to just float halfway.”  
And in the quiet, I found my start—  
Not in the doing, but in the heart.</div>
