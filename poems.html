    <h2>The Untamed Fire</h2>
    <p>
      There is no such thing as perfection,<br>
      My imperfections pave the way,<br>
      Something wild, free, and unbroken,<br>
      A storm that refuses to obey.

    <h2>Dream of Rebellion</h2>
    <p>
      They told me to fit in,<br>
      But I carve my own mark,<br>
      The night is my canvas,<br>
      And my name ignites the dark.

  <h2>Will I Regret?</h2>
  <p>
    Will I regret the times I stalled,<br>
    The chances missed, the dreams I called—<br>
    Then left unheard, beneath my doubt,<br>
    Too scared to scream, too worn to shout?<br><br>

    Will I regret the work half-done,<br>
    The races lost I could have won?<br>
    The lazy days, the fleeting fire,<br>
    The faded edge of once desire?<br><br>

    I tell myself, "You'll make it still,"<br>
    But time won't pause for fading will.<br>
    Each hour that slips through idle hands,<br>
    Could build the life my soul demands.<br><br>

    Will I regret not giving all,<br>
    When I still had the strength to fall—<br>
    And rise again, with dirt and grace,<br>
    Instead of quitting at half pace?<br><br>

    But maybe… maybe I will learn,<br>
    That purpose isn't always stern.<br>
    That stumbles count, that trying slow,<br>
    Still leads somewhere—still helps me grow.<br><br>

    So will I regret? The fear runs deep,<br>
    But I’ll build something I can keep.<br>
    Not perfect paths or flawless days—<br>
    But truth I lived in flawed, real ways.
