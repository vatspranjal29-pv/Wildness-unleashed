      <h2>Salt in My Soul 🧂</h2>
      <p>
I’m not the flame that steals the scene,  
Nor the velvet in a royal sheen.  
I’m quiet strength, not loud or bold,  
But without me, the story feels cold.  

In laughter's feast or silence deep,  
In moments loud or ones you keep,  
I’m there—unseen but understood,  
The touch that turns bland into good.  

I sit with joy, I walk with grief,  
I bring a pause, I grant relief.  
I never beg, I never boast,  
But I become what you need most.  

With strangers, I am light and kind,  
With friends, a peace they’re glad to find.  
In chaos, I can hold the ground,  
In stillness, I can wear the crown.  

Adaptive, yes—yet still my core,  
Unchanged though I’m asked for more.  
I bend, but never disappear,  
I'm felt the most when I'm sincere.  

So taste and see—don’t rush or shove,  
I’m best when measured, shared with love.  
Not too much, nor barely there,  
Just enough—and I’m everywhere.

      <h2>Running on Empty 🕯️</h2>
      <p>
I used to wake with fire in my chest,  
Now it’s just weight that won’t let me rest.  
My calendar's full, but my soul feels thin,  
Like I’m chasing a race I forgot to begin.  

Smiles worn like practiced art,  
But the cracks run deep beneath my heart.  
“Keep going,” they cheer — I nod, comply,  
Yet every breath feels like a lie.  

The to-dos scream louder than my needs,  
I water others, forget my own seeds.  
Eyes wide open, but the light is dim,  
Even silence feels like it’s wearing thin.  

It’s not that I’m weak, or don’t want to try,  
I’m just tired in ways no sleep can defy.  
A soul stretched thin, a mind worn out,  
An inner scream behind a whisper shout.  

But maybe rest is not defeat,  
Maybe pause is what makes strength complete.  
I’ll learn to breathe, not just survive—  
To stop, to heal, to feel alive.

      <h2>The Pause ⏸️</h2>
      <p>
I gave and gave, then gave some more,  
Till I forgot what I was doing it for.  
Each win felt empty, joy ran dry,  
Even the sunrise passed me by.  

They called me strong, they called me brave,  
But didn’t see the pieces I gave.  
Behind the work, beneath the grin,  
I barely knew the skin I’m in.  

Then one day—I didn’t rise.  
Just laid there, staring at the skies.  
And in that stillness, something stirred:  
A softer voice I hadn’t heard.  

“You don’t have to climb today.  
It’s okay to just float halfway.”  
And in the quiet, I found my start—  
Not in the doing, but in the heart.
