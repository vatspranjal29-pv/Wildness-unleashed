      <h2>Will I Regret???</h2>
      <p>
Will I regret the times I stalled,  
The chances missed, the dreams I called—  
Then left unheard, beneath my doubt,  
Too scared to scream, too worn to shout?  

Will I regret the work half-done,  
The races lost I could have won?  
The lazy days, the fleeting fire,  
The faded edge of once desire?  

I tell myself, "You'll make it still,"  
But time won't pause for fading will.  
Each hour that slips through idle hands,  
Could build the life my soul demands.  

Will I regret not giving all,  
When I still had the strength to fall—  
And rise again, with dirt and grace,  
Instead of quitting at half pace?  

But maybe… maybe I will learn,  
That purpose isn't always stern.  
That stumbles count, that trying slow,  
Still leads somewhere—still helps me grow.  

So will I regret? The fear runs deep,  
But I’ll build something I can keep.  
Not perfect paths or flawless days—  
But truth I lived in flawed, real ways.

      <h2>Like Salt🧂</h2>
      <p>
I am like salt, simple and small,  
Yet I blend in quietly, touching all.  
In every dish, in every soul,  
I never seek to take control.  

Too little of me—you’ll feel the lack,  
A silent space, a subtle crack.  
Too much—and I’ll sting the tongue,  
A harmony lost, a song unsung.  

I walk with fire, laugh with rain,  
Ease your joy, and soothe your pain.  
I don’t need to shine or lead,  
Just be the part that others need.  

From the richest plate to the poorest fare,  
You’ll find my spirit lingering there.  
Not loud or proud, but always true—  
A silent strength that carries through.  

I shift, I mold, I find my place,  
In every heart, in every space.  
Call me humble, or call me wise—  
I am salt—small, but I rise.

  <h3>What Will Happen?</h3>
  <p>
    I'm trying, yes, but not my best,<br>
    A silent war inside my chest.<br>
    I know the cost, I know the stakes,<br>
    Still find myself making mistakes.<br><br>

    I want to rise, I want to prove,<br>
    But some days I just cannot move.<br>
    When fire burns, I give my all,<br>
    When it goes dim, I slip, I fall.<br><br>

    Motivation—fickle friend,<br>
    Here one day, then meets its end.<br>
    When it’s strong, I scale the sky,<br>
    When it fades, I barely try.<br><br>

    I ask myself, “What will this mean?”<br>
    Will I be lost in might-have-beens?<br>
    Will dreams decay in silent rust,<br>
    All for a lack of constant trust?<br><br>

    But deep inside, beneath the doubt,<br>
    A voice still whispers, strong and loud:<br>
    “You are not made of perfect days,<br>
    But strength is shown in flawed displays.”<br><br>

    So what will happen? Time will say,<br>
    But I will rise in my own way.<br>
    Not always fierce, not always fast,<br>
    But still I move—and that will last.

      <h2>I Am the Storm🌪️</h2>
      <p>
I was the quiet one, eyes full of flame,  
Now they all shiver when they hear my name.  
Mocked my dreams? Well, joke’s on you—  
I built a throne from the shade you threw.  

Didn’t fit in? I never tried.  
Kings don’t blend, they multiply pride.  
Now I walk in with that “don’t-care” grin,  
And a fire so fierce, I burn to win.  

Friends turned rivals, haters in disguise,  
Watch me rise while they rehearse lies.  
I don’t flex cheap—I let my life scream,  
Luxury’s my silence, success is my scream.  

Call it revenge? I call it fate.  
You doubted gold ‘cause you saw it in slate.  
Now I shine like a war god’s crown,  
Watch me buy what once brought me down.  

No more limits, no second guess,  
I’m the calm chaos in tailored finesse.  
Spent too long being their maybe, their "not quite”—  
Now I’m first-class flying into every fight.  

I’m the answer to every eye that rolled,  
The living proof that stories unfold  
Not in their hands, not in their say—  
But in the silence of those who slay.  

You want humble? That phase is dead.  
Now I live bold, paint the skyline red.  
I'm not just rich—I'm out of your league,  
A walking revenge in designer intrigue.  

So when they ask, “How did you win?”  
I’ll smirk and say, “By never giving in.”  
Let my glow blind every fake smile swarm—  
I didn’t chase the light. I became the storm.

      <h2>Dreams Aren’t Distant✨</h2>
      <p>
Dreams aren’t distant, they start with you,  
Each step forward makes the sky more true.  
Rise with courage, let your fire ignite,  
Greatness is born when you dare to fight.

      <h2>Fuel the Fire🔥</h2>
      <p>
Fuel the fire, break the mold,  
Chase the future, fierce and bold.  
Every setback builds my climb,  
I turn the struggle into shine.
