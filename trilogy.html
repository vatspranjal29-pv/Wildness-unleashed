    <h1>Trilogy: The Ravages of Time</h1>
    <p>"Through Dust, Decay, and Defiance."</p>
    <h3>-By Pranjal Vats üåª</h3>

  <!-- Poem 1 -->
  <div class="poem">
    <h2>Part I. Whispers of the Hourglass üåå</h2>
    <p>
Time walks with silent, endless feet,  
A conqueror no soul can meet.  
It crowns the child, it bends the old,  
It buys with silver, it sells with gold.  

It hides in laughter, it sleeps in tears,  
It shapes the ages, it buries years.  
The strongest fall, the proud decay,  
Time carves its mark and walks away.  

We squander hours as though they stay,  
But moments vanish, lost in clay.  
The careless drift, the dreamers sigh,  
While Time records and passes by.  

Yet those who wake, who pierce its veil,  
Know every second tips the scale.  
They guard their days, they spend, not lose,  
They shape the path their hands must choose.  

For though Time strips both crown and throne,  
It bows to those who make it known:  
That life is brief, yet vast, divine‚Äî  
And they are masters of their time.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Poem 2 -->
  <div class="poem">
    <h2>Part II. The Sculptor‚Äôs Hands ü™∂</h2>
    <p>
Time is a sculptor, patient, cold,  
It shapes the young, it breaks the old.  
It writes in wrinkles, it inks in bone,  
A story etched, yet never shown.  

It waits in silence, sharp, unseen,  
It turns today to what has been.  
The fleeting hour, the wasted breath,  
All march in step toward certain death.  

Kings have begged, and poets prayed,  
But Time unmoved, has never swayed.  
It eats the empires, grinds the stone,  
And leaves the dreamer all alone.  

Yet wisdom blooms for those aware,  
Who treat each moment as treasure rare.  
They rise above, they seize, they climb,  
And live unbroken by Time‚Äôs crime.  

For Time may rule, but still it yields  
To hearts that harvest their own fields.  
Though fleeting, fragile, brief, sublime‚Äî  
The undefeated conquer Time.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Poem 3 -->
  <div class="poem">
    <h2>Part III. The Predator‚Äôs Chime üïØÔ∏è</h2>
    <p>
Time is a predator, sharp and slow,  
It hunts us all, above, below.  
It gnaws at bone, it drinks our youth,  
It strips away all but the truth.  

Castles crumble, empires fade,  
Dreams turn to dust, foundations laid.  
Time takes the victor, thief, and sage,  
It locks them all within its cage.  

It does not bargain, does not plead,  
It answers none, it knows no need.  
The mighty beg, the fragile cry,  
Yet all must kneel as hours pass by.  

It haunts the mirror, cold and near,  
It whispers loss into the ear.  
A steady hand, unseen, supreme,  
Unraveling life, unweaving dream.  

And yet the few who face its gaze,  
Who live their hours, who burn their days,  
They do not fear the clock‚Äôs grim chime‚Äî  
For they are victors over Time.
